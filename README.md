A game made for the [Warsaw Mermaid Game Jam](https://crpk.pl/wydarzenia/zapraszamy-do-udzialu-w-sounds-like-a-game-jam#) that got 2nd place.

The game is based on the [legend of the Basilisk](https://go2warsaw.pl/legenda-o-bazyliszku/) - a monster with the power to turn things to stone with its gaze.

You are a humble carpenter that is trying to get the Basilisk's treasure hidden behind many puzzle rooms.
